The next thing I will prioritize with this project are the following:
- Will make the added code more organize.
- Saving the List of Employees on Session after fetching it to the database to avoid repeatedly fetching in database.
- Use global error handler to avoid using try and catch for all the methods.
- Properly pass the parameters to Calculate method instead of passing it to the URL.
- Automatically set the Birthdate on Edit Page.
- Familiarize React.js and ASP.Net Core to efficiently use these programming tools in the future.
- Making the UI more responsive in all devices.
- Adding some collors to it instead of pure white.
-If possible, adding the Sprout icon on the header beside the "Sprout Exam Web App" can also look better.
